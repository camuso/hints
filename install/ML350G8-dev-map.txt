RH Partition Utility sees the number in parenthesis, since
it does not count the extended partition, but rather looks
at the logical partitions under it. For example, the extended
partition is sda4, and the first logical partition under that
is sda5. However, the RH partition utility may not recognize
the extended partition (sda4) and number the first logical
partition, sda5, as sda4 instead.

Legacy MBR can only access four partitions. However, grub 1.97- can access
more than four partitions up to 2.2TB. Grub 2.0+ can access beyond 2.2TB.

The grub "chainloader" command allows us to access more than four partitions
and boot four or more diffeent operating systems on the same disk.

In order to create a disk with more than four boot partitions, the fourth
and higher partitions must be located in an extended partition.

The chainloader presents the other Operating Systems in a grub menu on the
primary installed OS.

The primary linux OS will consume two partitions, one for "/boot" and one
for "/". The MBR will not need to directly access any more than these two
partitions, since the grub utility on the "/boot" partition of the primay
OS will "chain" to the grub facility of the "/boot" partitions of the other
Operating Systems.

A disk can be prepartitioned using a bootable utility like Parted Magic.
http://partedmagic.com/

Live (bootable) CDs and USB drives can be created with this utility on
them to prepartition the disk for later installation.

We can also use the parted tool that comes with Fedora and Red Hat install
images.


the other OS's

All the partitions will share "/swap", since only one OS will be booted at
any given time.

Customizing a RHEL distro DVD iso

Most of the following was taken from instructions found on ...
http://greghaygood.com/2007/12/11/build-a-custom-centos-5-install-cd
... and from lines I examined in Bryan Gartner's history when he
successfully built a custom distro.

Provision a system, virtual or real, with the distro of RHEL to be customized.

Login as root.

Create working directories.

# mkdir -p /work/iso/distro

Copy the distro files into a the work directory, for example ...

# rsync -av \
  blofly.usa.hp.com::LinuxISO/mrepo/RHEL5.7-Snapshot-2-Server-x86_64/disc1/ \
  /work/iso/distro

Make your changes. For example, new kernel files for a RHEL5 Server distro
would go into /work/iso/distro/Server

Add new boot drivers to the initrd, as required. (See customize-inird.txt)

Create a yum repo that points to the repo on the distribution disk being
customized, and create the file, "blofly.repo"

# cd /etc/yum.repos.d
# vi blofly.repo

Enter the following lines in the blofly.repo file.

[blofly]
baseurl=http://172.16.3.1/mrepo/RHEL5.7-Snapshot-2-Server-x86_64/RPMS.os
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0

Now install the anaconda anaconda-runtime and createrepo ustilities.

# yum install anaconda anaconda-runtime createrepo

Extract the discinfo that you need for the createrepo command.

# head -1 dvd/.discinfo
1306347199.171996

Now use the above disc info header to identify the local url of the repo.
Move into the directory just above the repodata directory.

# cd /work/iso/distro/Server
# createrepo -u "media://1306347199.171996#1" \
  -g repodata/comps-rhel5-server-core.xml  ./

Note that "#1" was appended to the media url to identify this as disc one
of the set.

Now create the dvd iso

# cd /work/iso
# mkisofs -r -R -J -T -v \
  -no-emul-boot \
  -boot-load-size 4 \
  -boot-info-table \
  -V "RHEL5.7-Server-20110609.JW" \
  -p "bryang" -A "RHEL5.7-Server-20110609.JW" \
  -b isolinux/isolinux.bin -c isolinux/boot.cat \
  -x "lost+found" \
  -o RHEL5.7-Server-20110609.JW-x86_64-DVD.iso \
  distro/

-o identifies the output file
"distro/" is the directory whose contents will be made into an iso dvd image.

See "man mkisofs" for details of the other options.

When the mkisofs is complete, you should see the output iso file in the
/work/iso directory.

Insert the MD5 signature.

# implantisomd5 RHEL5.7-Server-20110609.JW-x86_64-DVD.iso

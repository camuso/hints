Customizing a RHEL distro DVD iso
=================================

Most of the following was taken from instructions found on ...
http://greghaygood.com/2007/12/11/build-a-custom-centos-5-install-cd
... and from lines I examined in Bryan Gartner's history when he
successfully built a custom distro.

1. Provision a system, virtual or real, with the distro of RHEL to be customized.

   Login as root.

   Create some working directories.

   # mkdir -p /work/iso		# the dvd iso image gets downloaded here
   # mkdir -p /mnt/iso		# this is for the ro mounted dvd iso image
   # mkdir -p /work/distro	# this is for the rw distro tree

2. If you do not have access to the Red Hat internal network, then skip
   to step 3.

   Download the distro's dvd iso image from a source into a work directory.

   # cd /work/iso

   # wget \
     http://download.lab.bos.redhat.com/released/RHEL-6/6.4/Workstation/x86_64/iso/RHEL6.4-20130130.0-Workstation-x86_64-DVD1.iso

  If not, then 

3. Mount the iso image and copy its contents into a working tree.

   # mount -t iso9660 \
   /work/distro/RHEL6.4-20130130.0-Workstation-x86_64-DVD1.iso /mnt/iso
   
   # rsync -va /mnt/iso/ /work/distro/

   NOTE: The trailing "/" are important in the above rsync command.

4. Add new or modified files to the appropriate places in the distro's file tree.

5. Add new boot drivers to the initrd, as required. (See customize-inird.txt)

6. Now install the anaconda anaconda-runtime and createrepo ustilities.

   # yum install anaconda anaconda-runtime createrepo

   NOTE: hp-octane-01 already has these

7. Extract the discinfo that you need for the createrepo command.

   # cd /work/distro
   # head -1 .discinfo
   1359576195.347759

8. The local repo xml file will be in the repodata directory. In the case of the
   hp-octane-01, you will see it in /work/distro/repodata
   The file is named ...
   8d2a5ab0faa8e39a6f19919f9a7293dbf58ff129c08647a205f6b9971acc279b-comps-rhel6-Workstation.xml

   Strip the SHA hash off the filename.

   # cd /work/distro/repodata

   # mv 8d2a5ab0faa8e39a6f19919f9a7293dbf58ff129c08647a205f6b9971acc279b-comps-rhel6-Workstation.xml \
     comps-rhel6-Workstation.xml

   Past the above disc info header into the following createrepo command.

   # cd /work/distro
   # createrepo -u "media://1306347199.171996#1" \
     -g repodata/comps-rhel6-Workstation.xml  ./

   NOTE: "#1" was appended to the media url to identify this as disc one of the set.

9. Create the new dvd iso

   # cd /work
   # mkisofs -r -R -J -T -v \
     -no-emul-boot \
     -boot-load-size 4 \
     -boot-info-table \
     -V "RHEL6.4-Workstation-x86_64" \
     -p "tcamuso" \
     -A "RHEL6.4-Workstation-20130619-test" \
     -b isolinux/isolinux.bin -c isolinux/boot.cat \
     -x "lost+found" \
     -o RHEL6.4-Workstation-20130619-test-x86_64-DVD.iso \
     distro/


   -o identifies the output file
   "distro/" is the directory whose contents will be made into an iso dvd image.

   See "man mkisofs" for details of the other options.

   When the mkisofs is complete, you should see the output iso file in the
   /work directory.

10. Insert the MD5 signature.

    # implantisomd5 RHEL6.4-Workstation-20130619-test-x86_64-DVD.iso

   You now have an installable custom dvd iso image.

Best multiboot strategy.

* Install an OS leaving enough disk for all the other OS or distros you
  want to install.

* After installing and booting the OS, create a tiny partition, say 10
  or 16 MB for the grub partition.

  # fdisk /dev/sda
  Command (m for help): p	# print the current configuration

  Disk /dev/sda: 146.8 GB, 146778685440 bytes
  255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 17844 cylinders
  Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes
  Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
  I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
  Disk identifier: 0x000b604c

     Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
  /dev/sda1   *           1          64      512000   83  Linux
  Partition 1 does not end on cylinder boundary.
  /dev/sda2              64       17845   142825472   8e  Linux LVM

  Command (m for help): n		# new partition
  Command action
   e   extended
   p   primary partition (1-4)
   p					# select "primary" partition
   Partition number (1-4): 3		# select the next available number
					# : then chose the partition size
   Command (m for help): w		# write the new partition
   Command (m for help): q		# exit fdisk

   # reboot				# must reboot to access the new partition.

 * Format the new partition

   # mkfs.ext3 /dev/sda3

 * Copy the grub directory from the currently booted OS to a grub
   directory in the new partition

   # mount /dev/sda3 /mnt/temp
   # rsync -va /boot/grub /mnt/temp

 * Tell the MBR where to find the bootloader with the grub utility.
   We know that our main grub bootloader is in /dev/sda3. In grub,
   this is (hd0,2)

   # grub
   grub> root (hd0,2)		# aim at the place where we want the bootloader
   grub> setup (hd0)		# IMPORTANT - just (hd0) - NOT (hd0,2) !
   grub> quit
   #

* Next, you must edit the main bootloader grub's menu.lst to point to the
  various OS/distros in your system.
  Here is an example grub file where the main grub bootloader is on /dev/sda7

  # mount /dev/sda7 /mnt/temp
  # cat /mnt/temp/grub/menu.lst
	# grub.conf generated by anaconda
	#
	# Note that you do not have to rerun grub after making changes to this file
	# NOTICE:  You have a /boot partition.  This means that
	#          all kernel and initrd paths are relative to /boot/, eg.
	#          root (hd0,0)
	#          kernel /vmlinuz-version ro root=/dev/sda2
	#          initrd /initrd-[generic-]version.img
	#boot=/dev/sda
	default=0
	timeout=10
	# splashimage=(hd0,0)/grub/splash.xpm.gz
	# hiddenmenu
	title RHEL6.2 64-bit
		configfile (hd0,0)/grub/menu.lst

	title RHEL6.2 32-bit
		configfile (hd0,4)/grub/menu.lst

	title RHEL5.7 64-bit
		configfile (hd0,7)/grub/menu.lst

	title RHEL5.7 32-bit
		configfile (hd0,9)/grub/menu.lst

* When installing the other OS, especially if it's all RHEL, no need to give
  them each their own /swap partition. They can all share the same swap, since
  they won't all be booted at the same time.

* To see UUID of partition
	# dumpe2fs /dev/sda1 | grep UUID

How to use popen()

Posted 14 October 2012 - 02:47 AM
Hello again experts,

I would like to use the popen() function to execute a "daemon or shell command" and read the stout and do stuff according to the info in the stout.

for example; if the daemon outputs the word "start" to the stout, I would like it to activate a function in my program.

I have searched google for the usage of popen(), the information is confusing for me, if anyone could provide me with a simple working example of how to use popen()


regards

Just to reword some of my previous post:

I would like to use the popen() function to execute a "daemon or shell command" and read the stout and activate a function in my main program. (main).

regards

Why don't you start with something simple like
1	char buff[BUFSIZ];
2	FILE *fp = popen("ls","r");
3	while ( fgets( buff, BUFSIZ, fp ) != NULL ) {
4	  printf("LS->%s", buff );
5	}
6	pclose(fp);


Then maybe
ls -l

Then maybe the command you want to try.

I would like to create an infinte loop within the main program (main), maybe I need to fork() out the process.

The following loop checks if "progname" is running.


01	while (1)
02	{
03	 
04	sleep(1);
05	 
06	if (system("pstree | grep -q \"progname\"") == 0 ) {
07	 
08	// started function here
09	g_print("started\n");
10	 
11	 
12	} else {
13	 
14	// stopped function here
15	g_print("stopped\n");
16	}
17	 
18	 
19	}


If this loop is fork() "forked, spawned or cloned" as a child, can the child process still activate functions within the parent program.

Thankyou very much that makes it easier, to understand.

The trouble now is that the process I wish to run with popen() is an infinite loop, which checks if a program is running every 2 secs, so every other process in my main program get held up with this infinite loop, so I would like to run this process Parallel to my main program.

if I use
1	system("~/test");
for example it puts the program in the background, and outputs to stout.

Then I need a checking loop in my main program to check stout.

I just need to update my gui (the program I am writing) with the status of a running program. (if it is running or not)

I have this function for testing if the program is running, but how to use it in a loop without freezing my gui,

01	if (system("pstree | grep -q \"darkice\"") == 0 ) {
02	 
03	// Program is running
04	 
05	} else {
06	 
07	g_print("stopped\n");
08	 
09	// Program is not running
10	 
11	}



regards

I'm not sure if this is a good idea - it might just be opening a whole new can of worms for you.

Personally, I would strongly recommend you look at some of the ideas in your other thread, so you don't have to worry about creating a blocking point in your code.

Thread programming is hard to begin with (and exceedingly hard to debug!). Given that you're still using system() to do stuff for you, I don't think you're quite ready for this. A thread to watch a process is easy enough, but getting that thread to tell the rest of your program in a safe way is going to be that much harder for you.

If you use the underlying API calls (see your other thread), then it should be a relatively simple task to write something within a single threaded program, which doesn't block.

Anyhow, here goes.
01	#include <stdio.h>
02	#include <stdlib.h>
03	#include <pthread.h>
04	 
05	void *t1 ( void *p ) {
06	    int i;
07	    for ( i = 0 ; i < 10 ; i++ ) {
08	        printf("This is thread1\n");
09	        sleep(1);
10	    }
11	    pthread_exit(NULL);
12	}
13	void *t2 ( void *p ) {
14	    int i;
15	    for ( i = 0 ; i < 10 ; i++ ) {
16	        printf("This is thread2\n");
17	        sleep(3);
18	    }
19	    pthread_exit(NULL);
20	}
21	 
22	int main(void)
23	{
24	    pthread_t   p1, p2;
25	    pthread_create(&p1,NULL,t1,NULL);
26	    pthread_create(&p2,NULL,t2,NULL);
27	    printf("Main does some other stuff\n");
28	    sleep(5);
29	    pthread_exit(NULL);
30	    return 0;
31	}
32	 
33	 
34	$ gcc bar.c -pthread
35	$ ./a.out
36	Main does some other stuff
37	This is thread1
38	This is thread2
39	This is thread1
40	This is thread1
41	This is thread2
42	This is thread1
43	This is thread1
44	This is thread1
45	This is thread2
46	This is thread1
47	This is thread1
48	This is thread1
49	This is thread2
50	This is thread1
51	This is thread2
52	This is thread2
53	This is thread2
54	This is thread2
55	This is thread2
56	This is thread2

Each of your while(1) loops can go into a separate thread.

:bananaman: Thankyou for your example, thanks to you I know how to do this, I have used your code example in combination with my infinite program checking loop, like this;



01	#include <stdio.h>
02	#include <stdlib.h>
03	#include <pthread.h>
04	 
05	 
06	void *t1 ( void *p ) {
07	 
08	while (1)
09	{
10	sleep(1);
11	if (system("pstree | grep -q \"darkice\"") == 0 ) {
12	 
13	 
14	//gtk_label_set_text(GTK_LABEL (label_status), gettext("Streaming Status: Started"));
15	g_print("started\n");
16	 
17	} else {
18	 
19	//gtk_label_set_text(GTK_LABEL (label_status), gettext("Streaming Status: Stopped"));
20	g_print("stopped\n");
21	}
22	}
23	 
24	    pthread_exit(NULL);
25	}
26	 
27	 
28	 
29	int main(void)
30	{
31	    pthread_t   p1;
32	    pthread_create(&p1,NULL,t1,NULL);
33	    printf("Main does some other stuff\n");
34	     
35	   // I put my main program code here
36	 
37	    sleep(5);
38	    pthread_exit(NULL);
39	    return 0;
40	}



I think you example should you in the faq section of this forum, your example is the best and most easy to understand out of all my hours of searching on google.

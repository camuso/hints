[If you're planning on responding to this email thread with complaints about the
general crapiness of grub2 ... don't.  It isn't anything I've heard or the rest
of us have heard a billion times previously.  We're here and now.  If you want
to complain about it, you can file BZs or write emails to the grub-devel list.
*Jes, this means you.*]

I'm sharing a system with another team member (again, thank you :)) to debug a
problem with the firmware loading code upstream, and I noticed that my usual
tricks of using grub2-reboot (and my wrapper script for it, grub2-bootonce) were
not working.  While discussing the problem with the team member he mentioned
that he did the following in /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

if [ "${next_entry}" ] ; then
   set default="${next_entry}"
   set next_entry=
   save_env next_entry
   set boot_once=true
else
   set default=2
fi
set default=2

in order to always boot the second grub2 entry by default.  I've heard from
other engineers that grub2-reboot doesn't work all the time and I think I know
why...

The problem is that manually modifying /etc/grub2/grub.cfg breaks almost all of
the grub2-* scripts on the system, it is not sticky and the file will be
rewritten the moment the grub.cfg is regenerated.

The proper thing to do here is use

grub2-set-default 2

on the command line and that should be permanent.

IMO it is important for us to use the code that our customers will use and our
guides will be written such that they should use grub2-set-default.  It is
always important for us to "eat our own dogfood" even if it is just gruel.

So you've installed your laptop, rebooted, and you have no grub2, or you've
somehow magically booted into the dreaded grub2 prompt.  After you've finished
screaming at the computer gods for smiting you, follow these instructions which
should get you back up and running ...

[WARNING: some systems have UEFI enable/disable as well as things like
"Fast Boot" enable/disable in the BIOS.  The settings may have to be tweaked
before the laptop will boot.]

No grub2
--------

Take the live install media and boot into rescue or normal mode [AFAICT,
rescue mode in Fedora 18 does not work].

su -
mkdir ~/boot
mount /dev/sda2 ~/boot
mount /dev/sda1 ~/boot/efi

You need to install grub2-efi and shim packages via

yum -y install grub2-efi shim

[Note: no shim available in F17.  You may have to manually load the F18
package]

grub2-install --boot-directory=~/boot /dev/sda

[grub2-mkconfig will not work here, as it looks at /boot, not ~/boot]

reboot

and move onto the next section ...


The $%&^@!!! grub2 prompt at boot
---------------------------------

At the prompt do

ls

which will display all the partitions available, some will be marked as gpt
and others will be marked as regular old partitions.

Look at the gpt partitions to find your /boot, by using TAB-autocompletion

ex)

ls (hd0,gpt2)/

The above partition will be your grub2 "root" partition.  This is not the
"root" partition you normally use.

Execute the following:

1.  set root=(hd0,gpt2)
2.  linux vmlinux-3-....fc18.x86_64 root=/dev/dm-2

[Note that the step above took some trial-and-error to figure out that my
root partition was dm-2.  If you have grub2/grub.cfg available, cat it and
use the same boot arguments.]

3.  initrd initramfs-3-....fc18.x86_64
4.  boot

The system should boot at this time.


Fixing/Reinstalling grub2
-------------------------

1.  Login as root.
2.  Execute

grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
grub2-install --boot-directory=/boot /dev/sda

3.  Reboot and that should work ...

/me just spent the AM figuring that out.

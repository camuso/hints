## Push the new tar file into the centos-stream.
$ centpkg upload pigz-2.8.tar.gz

## That should change the sources file in your current directory,
## so that git status will show the source diff to have the new
## version number of the upstream tar file.

# Make your edits, updates, rebase, etc.
# Update the .spec file to the appropriate NVR.
# - Update the changelog in the .spec file and be sure to include
#   Resolves: RHEL-<Jira-number>
#
# Test the build
# For some reason I don't yet understand, rhpkg local won't do this.
 $ centpkg local

# Make necessary changes until the build succeeds.
# Run tests on the resulting package from the build.
# If the build and tests succeed, commit your changes.
$ git commit . -s
#
# Be sure to add the following to the commit message.
# Resolves: RHEL-<Jira-number>
#
# Now push your changes to your fork
$ git push tcamuso 70287

# The push will give you a link to a new MR. Go to that link
# and fill out the new MR. Opt for AutoMerge and delete branch
# when merged.
# NOTE:
#   MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE MERGING INTO THE CORRECT BRANCH!
#   THE DEFAULT IS c10s !!
#
# The CKI test will likely fail, so the branch won't merge
# until you prep the RHEL side.

##  Create the MR and go through the process of getting merged.
##  (magic occurs here...    :-/   )

# =========
# RHEL side
# =========

# Get the RHEL version of the package.
$ cd /work/pigz
$ rhpkg co pigz rh
$ cd rh
$ git checkout rhel-9-main
# In this example, we are building for RHEL-9.6, but we must
# push RHEL-9.5.0 into the origin. This is a mystery to me,
# but nothing on the RHEL side works until you do this.
$ git push origin rhel-9-main:rhel-9.5.0

# Go back to the MR for c9s that you created and rerun the CKI
# test that failed. After the above RHEL side prep, it should
# now succeed.
#
# After your MR has been merged, you can pull the changes into
# the cs side.

$ cd ../cd
$ git pull

# You should see a git update.
# Check the git log to be sure your changes are there.
# If all is well, built the release rpm
# Do a scratch build to see that it all works without errors.
$ centpkg build

# That should kick-off the whole errata thing.
# You will be alerted if there are any problems that need fixing
# or waiving.


##  Preliminary testing 'Requested' should be set by the Jira bot,
##  If not, in the Jira: Edit > Development
##
##  After QA does their job and sets Pass, the automation will create an
##  erratum (in NEW_FILES), which will have to be moved to the QE state.
#
##  When you are notified that the Errata has been created, log into
##  the Errata and move it to QE

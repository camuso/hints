        I don't have the skills / context to answer this, I'm wondering were you looking for some of my old reports?

            Good morning.

            I have a package that needs to be updated. This used to be
            a relatively simple process consisting of ...

            . Download the new package tar

            . Do a local build for sanity check using ...
               rhpkg local
               centpkg local

            . Make any necessary code changes
            . Test

            . Upload the new tar to the dist-git
               rhpkg upload
               centpkg upload

            . Remove the old SHA hash from the sources file.
            . Update the spec file
            . Commit the changes to git

            . Push the updated package
               rhpkg push
               centpkg push

            . Build the updated package
               rhpkg build
               centpkg build

            . Create and manage Errata

            This process does not work anymore, and I have no idea how to
            get this done.

First of all, the above behavior is still the proper course for changes going
$ git push <gitlabusername> <branchname>
into a Z-stream release. If they are instead going into the next Y-stream

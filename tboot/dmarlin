<dmarlin> tcamuso: notice that the version is in the source file name:
<dmarlin>   Source0:        http://downloads.sourceforge.net/%{name}/%{name}-%{version}.tar.gz
<dmarlin> so the version and the tarball file name have to match
<dmarlin> did you change the source tarball?
* dmarlin does not know what changed, or needed to change
<dmarlin> if you just added a patch, or changed something in the spec (config, etc.), then you should only change the 'Release' and not the version
<dmarlin> that way the tarball filename would still match
<dmarlin> if you changed the source itself (tarball), then just make sure the version matches the tarball file name
<tcamuso> I ichanged the tarball. 
<tcamuso> But I have the tarball in the same directory as the spec file
<dmarlin> ok, then you should just need to make sure the filename matches what's in the spec
<dmarlin> ah, the tarball should be in the SOURCES directory, if using rpm locally
<tcamuso> tboot-1.8.3.tar.gz is what I have
<dmarlin> anything in the spec labeled as SourceX: will be searched in SOURCES
<dmarlin> patches as well
<tcamuso> No, I'm trying to run a brew biuld with "rhpkg scratch-build"
<dmarlin> hmm... ok... how did you make the srpm?
<tcamuso> you can see the output at https://brewweb.devel.redhat.com/taskinfo?taskID=10323556
<dmarlin> ok, thanks
<dmarlin> looking...
<tcamuso> Hmmm. I didn't make an srpm.
<tcamuso> I thought the rhpkg app would do it.
<dmarlin> sorry, so many ways to do these things, and I only know the few I use
<tcamuso> Understood.
<dmarlin> looking at the logs now...
<tcamuso> I'm running on notes I took a couple years ago. 
<tcamuso> Don't even know where I got them.
<dmarlin> let me look for some rhpkg notes...
* dmarlin has not used it in a while
<tcamuso> MANY thanks
<dmarlin> np... I should know these things, but... so many tools...   :-/
<dmarlin> ok, when I used it last I did the following:
<dmarlin> rhpkg clone <package>
<dmarlin> pushd <package>
<tcamuso> Yup
<dmarlin> rhpkg switch-branch <branch>
<dmarlin>   (make any changes)
<dmarlin> rhpkg --dist=<distribution> srpm
<tcamuso> OK, I don't have those in my notes.
<dmarlin> rhpkg build --scratch --target <target>  --srpm <SRPM>
<tcamuso> I'll send you ca copy of the notes I have for critique.
<dmarlin> "rhpkg --dist=<distribution> srpm"  makes the SRPM
<dmarlin> there are probably other ways to do it... this is just what I've used
<dmarlin> if you commited everything to git and pushed it, then you could probably build 'from' git, but I typically just use local sources for scratch builds
<tcamuso> I'll try your method, since it seems to be more specific than the one I was using.
<dmarlin> I think " --dist=<distribution>  " is optional, but I use it to be sure I'm not getting the wrong default
<dmarlin> i.e., for aarch64 I use --dist=rhel-7.2-aarch64
<tcamuso> Heh. tboot only supports x86_64
<tcamuso> BUT it can't hurt to be specific
<dmarlin> well, I won't be building that one.    ;-)
<dmarlin> from your notes, did you attempt "rhpkg local" ?
<tcamuso> Yes.
<dmarlin> and no errors?
<tcamuso> I got an error at the end that I didn't understand/
<tcamuso> Dest dir longer than base dir is not supported
<tcamuso> error: Bad exit status from /var/tmp/rpm-tmp.FUUVsa (%install)
<tcamuso> RPM build errors:
<tcamuso>     Bad exit status from /var/tmp/rpm-tmp.FUUVsa (%install)
<tcamuso> Could not execute local: Non zero exit
<dmarlin> hmm... that is an odd one
<tcamuso> Dest dir longer than base dir? What's that supposed to mean?
<dmarlin> really... not sure
<tcamuso> Who would know?
<tcamuso> Who is maintainer for rhpkg?
<dmarlin> good question... one of our 'internal' tools
<tcamuso> Better questions is how can I find out who is maintainer.
<dmarlin> so if you are still in the directory (git) please try:
<tcamuso> yes
<dmarlin>  rhpkg  srpm
<dmarlin> and see if it can make one
<tcamuso> $ rhpkg srpm
<tcamuso> error getting product information for rhel-6.8, assuming it's unreleased
<tcamuso> Wrote: /work/tboot/tboot-1.8.3-1.el6.src.rpm
<dmarlin> ok, so it made an srpm
<dmarlin> please see what's in it:
<dmarlin>   rpm -qlp -1.8.3-1.el6.src.rpm
<tcamuso> $ rpm -q --filesbypkg -p tboot-1.8.3-1.el6.src.rpm
<tcamuso> tboot                     tboot-1.8.3-README.patch
<tcamuso> tboot                     tboot-1.8.3-cmdline-size.patch
<tcamuso> tboot                     tboot-1.8.3-coverity.patch
<tcamuso> tboot                     tboot-1.8.3.tar.gz
<tcamuso> tboot                     tboot.spec
<dmarlin> looks good
<tcamuso> JUst the tar file and a couple patches.
<tcamuso> Yes, intersetingly.
<dmarlin> one moment... call
<tcamuso> call?
<dmarlin> I got a call
<tcamuso> Oh.
<tcamuso> I've gotta run. I'll try your method and see if I can get better results.
<dmarlin>   rhpkg build --scratch --target <TARGET> --srpm tboot-1.8.3-1.el6.src.rpm
<dmarlin> if that works, then the only issue would be in the git operations (behind the scenes)
<dmarlin>  please make sure the "rhpkg upload tboot-1.8.3.tar.gz " had the right file name and completed successfully
<dmarlin> and that the 'sources file' is correct and was part of the commit
<dmarlin> (steps 7 and 8)
* dmarlin did not see where "the sources file" was added to the commit... maybe a missing step?
<tcamuso> Thanks!
<dmarlin>    $ git add tboot.spec
<dmarlin>    $ git commit 
<tcamuso> Hmmm. I think I did a git commit -a
<tcamuso> But I will check.
<dmarlin> ok, thanks
<tcamuso> That would be a killer if I did something stupid like that.
<dmarlin> easy to overlook

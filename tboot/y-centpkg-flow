# Clone the package from rhel into a rhel directory
#
$ rhpkg co <package> <rheldir>
  (or "git fetch origin" to get the latest state)
  Example for RHEL9.
  $ rhpkg clone tboot 9.5 # clones tboot into directory 9.5
  # NOTE: This is the only place you use rhpkg. centpkg is used for the
  # remainder of the process.

# rhel-9 example
# NOTE:
#  You must push the point release PREVIOUS to the point release you are
#  working on.
#  So, for rhel-9.5 ...
#
$ git checkout rhel-9-main
$ git push origin rhel-9-main:rhel-9.4.0  # <- note PREVIOUS RHEL
$ centpkg fork[1]  # <- MUST use centpkg fork
$ git checkout -b <branchname[2]>  # <- use JIRA number for branchname

# tboot example for fetching an upstream tar file
#
$ curl -L \
	https://sourceforge.net/projects/tboot/files/latest/download?source=files \
	-o tboot-1.11.2.tar.gz
$
$ centpkg upload <package.tar.gz>

# Make packaging changes, including updating the NVR and change log
# in the spec file.

# Test the build and make any required fixes
#
$ centpkg local

# If all is good with the local build, testing the resulting rpm, then...
#
$ git commit -s .
$ git push <gitlabusername> <branchname>

# This step should provide you with a URL to create a merge request into CentOS
# Stream[3]. That will trigger some CI checks as well. Once the MR is approved,
# you can merge it through the Gitlab WebUI.
#
# After the MR is merged (into the c8s or c9s branch), create or cd to a centos
# directory.
#
$ centpkg co <package> <centosdir>

# Make sure you have the commit from the merged MR.
#
$ git pull

# Now test build the package
#
rhpkg --release rhel-9.5.0 build --scratch --srpm # <- test build

# The directory tree I'm using is ...
/work/tboot/rhel-9.5
# /work/tboot/devel/rhel

# ... for all the above steps.
#
# Now you must create or update a centos directory

$ cd ..
$ pwd
/work/tboot/devel

$ centpkg co tboot cpkg
$ cd cpkg
   ... or if you already have a centos directory for this package  ...
$ cd cpkg
$ git fetch --all

# Example for RHEL-9.5.0
#
# These are the branches you will see in the centos directory.
#
$ git branch -r
  origin/HEAD -> origin/c9s
  origin/c10s
  origin/c8s
  origin/c9s

# Checkout the c8s branch
$ git checkout -b c9s origin/c9s

# Make sure your changes have propagated from the merge
$ gitnice -d
873df01  2023-11-03 Rebase to upstream 1.11.2 and bump nvr to 1.11.2-1

# Now do the formal build in the c9s directory
#
rhpkg --release rhel-9.5.0 build

This last step will trigger both the CentOS Stream and RHEL builds.


[1] This may fail the first time if you don't have an API token set up. Run
`centpkg fork -h` for instructions on how to do so.
 MUST use centpkg fork.

[2] Don't start the branch name with `rhel-`. There's a known bug in Gitlab:
https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/378945

[3] If you haven't logged into the `/redhat/centos` section of the Gitlab Web
UI recently, you may stumble across
https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/391765 which results in being
provided the wrong URL to create the merge request. If that happens, you may
need to browse to the dist-git repo directly and create the MR manually.

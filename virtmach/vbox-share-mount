When you name a share, the name is prefixed by 'sf_' and mounted on
	/media/sf_<share-name>

If you want to change the default mount point, see
	http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html#sf_mount_manual

The share is mounted by vbox with root.vboxsf owner.group, which
prevents access by normal users. The share can be remounted with
the folloiwng command ...

#  mount -t vboxsf -o fmode=775,dmode=665,uid=nobody,gid=nobody node /media/sf_node

... to set the owner.group to nobody.nobody, file access = 775 and
directory access = 665. This will allow for anonymous read and execution
access while inhibiting file and directory creation by anyone other
than root.

You can mount the share at a different mount point this way.

# umount /media/sf_node
# mount -t vboxsf -o fmode=775,dmode=665,uid=nobody,gid=nobody node \
	/home/tcamuso/node

# cat /etc/group | grep tcamuso
(standard input):69:tcamuso:x:1000:

# mount -t vboxsf -o rw,uid=1000,gid=1000 work /home/tcamuso/host

All of the above is interesting, but ...

To be sure that you can read and write the shared volume, do the following.
On the host system, you must open the volume to allow rwx access to everyone
and anyone. I will be doing this with the "work" directory in my host
system.

$ sudo chmod -R ugo+rwx work

On the guest system, create a mount point. I will create one off the user's
home directory and call it "host", then I will mount it with the current
user as owner.

$ mkdir ~/host
$ sudo mount -t vboxsf -o uid=$(id -u),gid=$(id -g) work ~/host

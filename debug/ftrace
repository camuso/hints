One backup plan that should help give us a clue is using ftrace
(_extremely_ verbose on console)

mount -t debugfs debugfs /sys/kernel/debug
cd /sys/kernel/debug/tracing

echo 0 > tracing_on
echo function > current_tracer
echo FUNCTIONS  >> set_ftrace_filter
echo 1 > tracing_on
cat trace

where FUNCTIONS can be limited to "*idle* *irq* *raid*" for now
and we can build it up later.  This is to limit the noise spewed on the
console.

see 'cat available_filter_functions' for a complete list of functions to trace

just remember to use '>>' to append to set_ftrace_filter (or just cat the file
to make sure everything took correctly)

This is what works for me on beaker systems:

Install the appropriate rcm-tools repo file[1] in /etc/yum.repos.d:

# curl -o /etc/yum.repos.d/rcm-tools-rhel-9-baseos.repo https://download.devel.redhat.com/rel-eng/RCMTOOLS/rcm-tools-rhel-9-baseos.repo

Aternatively ...
	wget --no-check-certificate \
	https://download.devel.redhat.com/rel-eng/RCMTOOLS/rcm-tools-rhel-9-baseos.repo

Install the IT CA certificates:

# curl -o /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/RH-IT-Root-CA.crt https://certs.corp.redhat.com/certs/2015-IT-Root-CA.pem
# curl -o /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/2022-IT-Root-CA.pem https://certs.corp.redhat.com/certs/2022-IT-Root-CA.pem
# update-ca-trust

After that, installing packages from the rcm repo works for me.

Cheers,
Jeff

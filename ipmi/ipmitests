Local tests on ipmi host
========================

Basic sanity test
-----------------
# ipmiloop

Watchdog test
-------------
First, be sure there are no other watchdogs loaded.
Look for iTCO_wdt and hpwdt.
You may have to blacklist these and reboot.
You can use tcamuso's blacklist script.

First get the watchdog going

Load watchdog with timeout=60

# modprobe -v ipmi_watchdog timeout=60

Install OpenIPMI and start the app
# yum install OpenIPMI
# vim /etc/sysconfig/ipmi

Uncomment the following line
IPMI_WATCHDOG_OPTIONS="timeout=60"

# systemctl start ipmi

# vim /etc/systemd/system.conf

Uncomment the following line
RuntimeWatchdogSec=60

# systemctl daemon-reexec

Then run the ipmigetwd script to see the watchdog ticking.

# ipmigetwd

... or alternatively ...

count=0
while true; do
	let count++
	echo "Cycle Counter: $count"
	ipmitool bmc watchdog get
	echo
	sleep 1
done

==================================
Tests from remote host to ipmihost
==================================

This test assumes user "root"
If the ipmi on the test host is configured with a password for root,
you must type the password for each test, until I can get an "expect"
script up and running.

$ ipmilantest ip.of.ipmi.host

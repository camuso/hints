# sierra12 /root > ipmi-raw 0x00 0x06 0x31
rcvd: 31 00 02

     0x31 is "get message flags", and the response of 0x02 means the event
message buffer is full. So rightfully, the driver next attempts to read a
message from the event message buffer:

# sierra12 /root > ipmi-raw 0x00 0x06 0x35
rcvd: 35 80

     The 0x80 response is "data not available (queue / buffer empty)"
according to the spec.  And so we get stuck in an endless loop trying to
clear a buffer that's simultaneously full and empty.  So to delve a bit
further, I did a "Get BMC global enables":

# sierra12 /root > ipmi-raw 0x00 0x06 0x2f
rcvd: 2F 00 0D

     The 0x0d tells us that the event message buffer is indeed enabled.
So let's try clearing the event message flag and reading the result:


# sierra12 /root > ipmi-raw 0x00 0x06 0x30 0x02
rcvd: 30 00
# sierra12 /root > ipmi-raw 0x00 0x06 0x31
rcvd: 31 00 02

     Nope, the bit is still stuck.  OK, well, let's try something drastic.
Let's tell the BMC to do a cold reset.


# sierra12 /root > ipmi-raw 0x00 0x06 0x02
rcvd: 02 00

     This caused IPMI commands to start timing out for a while (30-60
seconds maybe, I wasn't paying enough attention).  But when things started
responding again,

# sierra12 /root > ipmi-raw 0x00 0x06 0x01
rcvd: 01 00 25 01 01 26 02 BF 59 50 00 34 00 6E 6D 00 00
# sierra12 /root > ipmi-raw 0x00 0x06 0x31
rcvd: 31 00 00

     Voila, our stuck flag bit is cleared!

     I tried a warm reset as well, which didn't seem to be enough to clear out
the issue.  The spec seems to warn against doing a cold reset on a running
system, so if there are any suggestions for less invasive things to try to
clear the stuck bit, I'll gladly test them.

# Change the action on suspend/hibernate. Write "test" to the
# file named "disk" causes the default action to be "test", as
# shown by the square brackets.
#
# cat disk
[platform] test testproc shutdown reboot
# echo test > disk
# cat disk
platform [test] testproc shutdown reboot

# Writing the string "disk" to the "state" file causes the system
# to hibernate and perform the default action.
#
#  echo disk > state

# Change the default action to "reboot" and initiate "suspend" mode
# by writing the string "mem" to the "state" file.
#
# echo reboot > disk
# echo disk > state

# Alternatively, you could issue the pm-tools commands.

# pm-hibernate
# pm-suspend

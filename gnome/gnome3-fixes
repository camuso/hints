INSTALL THESE TOOLS
===================

yum install gnome-tweak-tool dconf dconf-editor gconf-editor

See http://www.scribd.com/doc/52625225/Customizing-the-GNOME-3-Shell

---------------------------------------------------------------------

gnome-tweak-tool (without this, almost nothing can be fixed):
 yum install gnome-tweak-tool

Sane key bindings (gtk3 and gtk2) - note this can finally be done in
gnome-tweak-tool, after years of the GNOME trying to hinder usability
by forcing us unto unusable Windows style bindings:
 gnome-tweak-tool
  Theme->Keybinding theme
 (manual way:
   dconf write /org/gnome/desktop/interface/gtk-key-theme "'Emacs'"
   gconftool-2 --set /desktop/gnome/interface/gtk_key_theme Emacs --type string
 )

Set keyboard shortcuts to jump to workspaces >=5:
 dconf write /org/gnome/desktop/wm/keybindings/switch-to-workspace-5 [\'\<Alt\>F5\']
 dconf write /org/gnome/desktop/wm/keybindings/switch-to-workspace-6 [\'\<Alt\>F6\']

Set keyboard shortcuts to move window to workspaces >=5:
 dconf write /org/gnome/desktop/wm/keybindings/switch-to-workspace-6 [\'\<Alt\>F6\']
  dconf write /org/gnome/desktop/wm/keybindings/switch-to-workspace-6 [\'\<Alt\>F6\']

Stop gnome-terminal from hijacking important key-bindings (like Alt-b):
 Edit->Keyboard Shortcuts->Enable Menu Access Keys (uncheck)

Focus-follows-mouse:
 gnome-tweak-tool
  Windows->Window focus mode

Icons back on the desktop:
 gnome-tweak-tool
  File Manager->Have file manager handle the desktop

Reboot/shutdown buttons in menu:
 yum install gnome-shell-extension-alternative-status-menu.noarch

Swap CTRL vs CAPS-LOCK:
 Settings->Region and Language->Layouts->Options->Ctrl key position

Stop gnome-shell from constantly full-screening a window when you move
it too close to the edge (note this one is tricky, gnome-shell needs
to be restarted for the change to take effect or Alt-F2 r):
 dconf write /org/gnome/shell/overrides/edge-tiling false
 gconftool-2 --set /desktop/gnome/shell/windows/edge_tiling --type Bool false

Import saved VPN profiles:
 nm-connection-editor

Mobile broadband configuration (not that they work in the first place):
 nm-connection-editor

Auto-enable wired Ethernet:
 Network->Network Settings->Wired->Options->Connect automatically

XChat notifications:
 Settings->Preferences->Chatting->Alerts->Show tray balloons

Get rid of idiotic animations when switching workspaces:
 https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/119/disable-window-animations/

Get back your static workspaces (regain your sanity):
 https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/12/

Replace chaotic activities with application menu:
 https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/13/applications-menu/

Get back the shutdown menu:
 https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/14/

Disable 5^#&*^$%^%$ 'tracker' retardedness eating your battery
 gnome-session-properties  (untick all items under tracker-*)

Information I am looking for
============================

1) How to get Empathy to pop up proper chat windows instead of using the
annoying pointless notification bar?

2) How to be able to specify default parameters for apps launched from
gnome-shell. Ie. I want firefox launched with --no-remote *always*

3) How to default to opening a new window for a given app, rather than
jumping to the already open one. I run many terminal windows and I
don't want to rely on just one.

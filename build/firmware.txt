# unzip netxen-fw-phan.patch.zip

# cd rhel6

# patch -p1 < ../netxen-fw-phan.patch

# git add firmware/phanfw.bin.ihex

This patch was created using the following steps.

      repo cloned from the following location.
      git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/dwmw2/linux-firmware.git

    * The file was converted to ihex format with the following command
      # objcopy -I binary -O ihex phanfw.bin phanfw.bin.ihex

    * The file was copied into the firmware/directory of the RHEL6 git tree
      # cp phanfw.bin.ihex firmware/

    * The file was conditionally added in order to generate a diff.

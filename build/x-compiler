Tony needed these, so I'm assuming others do as well.  This is known to work
well on pristine or near-to-pristine latest RHEL6.4 environments (ie, systems
reserved from beaker).

1.  check out a rhel6 git tree.
2.  apply my patch
3.  If you don't have one, set up /etc/yum.repos.d/rhel6-optional.repo

[rhel6 optional]
name=rhel6-optional
baseurl=http://download.eng.bos.redhat.com/nightly/latest-RHEL6/6.4/Server/optional/x86_64/os
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
skip_if_unavailable=1

NOTE: You should use an appropriate repo for your OS.  For example, if you're
using 6.3, use

baseurl=http://download.eng.bos.redhat.com/released/RHEL-6/6.3/Server/optional/x86_64/os/

NOTE: beaker sets up a beaker-optional.repo that should just work.

4.  go back to
 git tree and as *root* execute

make rh-cross-download

which will install a tonne of rpms onto your system.  These rpms are required
for building glibc, gcc, binutils, gdb and the kernel rpms.

[Note, this step should only have to be executed a single time.]

5.  As anyuser, pick a target, preferably make rh-cross-all-builds

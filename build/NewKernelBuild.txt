/boot/grub/grub.cfg takes the place of Grub-v1 grub.conf (menu.lst).

After building a new kernel, in order to get it into the grub menu, you need to issue the following command as root. 

For example, after downloading the latest kernel from Linus' git tree ...

# make mrproper
# make oldconfig
# make 
# make modules_install
# make install
# update-initramfs -c -k 2.6.38-rc4+
# update-grub

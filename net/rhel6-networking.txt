Redhat 6 Networking

Redhat 6 does not configure network interfaces on default installation.
Also, it is configured to use NetworkManager. To enable networking interface
and disable NetworkManager please follow instructions below.

The /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 content looks as follows
on default installation.

DEVICE="eth0"
HWADDR=specifc mac address
NM_CONTROLLED="yes"
ONBOOT="no"


For DHCP, configure the interface as follows.

DEVICE="eth0"
HWADDR=specifc mac address
NM_CONTROLLED="no"
ONBOOT="yes"
BOOTPROTO="dhcp"


 Restart the network after configuration.
/etc/init.d/network restart

For Static ip, configure it as follows

DEVICE="eth0"
HWADDR=specifc mac address
NM_CONTROLLED="no"
ONBOOT="yes"
BOOTPROTO="static"
IPADDR=ip address here.
NETMASK=netmask here.

Change the /etc/sysconfig/network to have the GATEWAY.

NETWORKING=yes
HOSTNAME=www1.nixcraft.in
GATEWAY=gateway address here.

Change /etc/resolve.conf
nameserver Specify ip address of dns server/usually same as gateway.

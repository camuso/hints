1. Host running latest RHEL6.4 snapshot 
   Guest VM running RHEL6.3 connected NAT to host eth2 
   through guest virtual eth0.
  
   Host  eth2 - 10.16.46.186 NAT to vibr0 192.168.122.1
   Guest eth0 - 192.168.122.162

2. To create traffic, I used netcat as follows.

   On the host, issued the following command.
     # yes AAAAAAAA | nc -v -l 2222 > /dev/null

   On the guest VM, issued the following command.
     # yes BBBBBBBB | nc 10.16.46.186 2222 > /dev/null

   Using gnome-system-monitor gui on both systems, I was able to see 
   network traffic increase dramatically. 

3. To shape traffic, I used the tc script I attached in comment #5 above
   on both the host and the guest, as follows. 

   # tctest start

4. To monitor, I did the following on both systems. 
   # while [ 1 ]; do tctest show eth<x>; sleep 5; done;

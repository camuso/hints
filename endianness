From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_endian

Large integers are usually stored in memory as a sequence of smaller ones
and obtained by simple concatenation. The simple forms are:

*    increasing numeric significance with increasing memory addresses (or
     increasing time), known as little-endian, and
*    decreasing numeric significance with increasing memory addresses (or
     increasing time), known as big-endian[2]

       MSB LSB
BEND -  03 E8
LEND -  E8 03

Architecture Endianness
Bi indicates Archs whose endianness can be programmed. Those with a defualt,
or endianness that preceded their programmable capability, will also have
an entry in the Big or Little Column.

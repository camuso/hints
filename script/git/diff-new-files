Add the list of new files to a text file by cutting-and-pasting from the
RHEL patch that has the list of new or changed files.

vim ../filelist		# <- paste the list into a text file

In this case, the upstream files were in a different directory than the
RHEL files, so we need to change the directory reference in order to
find the upstream files in the upstream tree.

replacetext /i40evf/ /ethernet/intel/i40evf/ ../filelist

Next, we create the diff of the new or modified files with the following
loop command.

[tcamuso@tcamuso linux]$ while read line; do
	filespec=$(echo $line | cut -d' ' -f1)
	echo $filespec
	gitbranchdiff 1a1f9dd7d5480f87ff8b763a4a62fafe7901fae2 net-next ../temp/0001-no.patch $filespec
done < ../filelist

gitbranchdiff script ...
#!/bin/bash
git diff $1 $2 -- $4 >> $3

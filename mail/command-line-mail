You need a .mailrc file in your home directory.

$ cat ~/.mailrc
set smtp=smtp.corp.redhat.com
set ssl-verify=ignore
set from="Tony Camuso <tcamuso@redhat.com>"

After that, simply type ...

$ mail -s "A subject line" anybody@anyip.com

Then type ctrl-D to send.

You can actually type in a message body, and then type ctrl-D if
you like, but I usually just send short messages in the subject
line.

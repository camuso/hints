There is also another possibility --- if the content is copyrighted,
the owners may opt to introduce deliberate errors in order to prevent
copying the contents of the disc. If that is the case, vlc will
attempt to read only the files it needs, and would not see the error,
while cp would try to copy everything, and get stuck.

Others have suggested dd and variants, to make an identical copy of the
data on the disc. However, if your aim is to get a copy of the video
content of the disc, you can also use mplayer to copy the video to your
HD. Something like this:

   mplayer dvd:// -dumpstream -dumpfile my/video/file.avi

This will "dump" the actual movie into a file, rather than onto the
screen (and speakers). You can be more selective by using dvd://2,4-6 to
play only the tracks you are interested in, or use -dumpvideo or
-dumpaudio instead of -dumpstream to separately copy video only or
audio only. You may want to get familiar with "man mplayer". Just don't
get too scared by the amount of options in the manual. 

The quality of the dump is of course equal to the original, since it's
just copying, not transcoding. The resulting file size will be the size
of the video data on the dvd disc itself (most, but not equal to the
size of the dvd disc). The dumped file can be played by any video
player (vlc, mplayer, ...) that supports MPEG, by pointing it to the
file.

In general, as far as mplayer usage goes --- if you can see the video
on the screen by playing it in mplayer, then you can also dump it in a
file instead, to make a copy. And generically mplayer will play
everything you throw at it, including copyrighted dvds with deliberate
errors etc... 

Oh, and you may also want to install the libdvdcss package from
the old Livna repository (http://rpm.livna.org/), in order to get
around the CSS enryption (Content Scramble System) for some
copyrighted dvds...

HTH,

If you omit the track number, mplayer will play the "default" track,
which is usually track 1. However, I've seen dvds which change this
default --- apparently in the dvd's table of contents it might be
indicated what is considered to be the "default tracks to play", and
mplayer will play that, if found. It does not necessarily mean
"everything on the whole disc".

Of course, you may specify the track number(s) explicitly, if and when
you know which one you want to play.

Yes, you're right.  I got used to the fact that Linux doesn't care
about file extensions, so I use .avi just as a reminder for myself that
it is a file containing multimedia (i.e. audio and video). But someone
else might try to play the file in a non-Linux environment, and then a
file extension might be relevant.

The DVD video format is usually mpeg-2 for video and AAC for audio,
which are packed up into a mpeg-ps container format. According to
wikipedia [1], it has the following typical file extensions:

  .mpg, .mpeg, .m2p, .ps

So maybe a better filename would be file.mpeg or similar.

Best, 
Marko

Howto: Linux write (burn) data to DVD or DVD/RW

by NIX Craft on July 8, 2006 · 18 comments· LAST UPDATED July 10, 2007

in Howto, Linux, RedHat/Fedora Linux

In order to write DVD/DVD-RW from shell prompt you need to install a package
called dvd+rw-tools.

DVD is another good option for backup, archiving, data exchange etc. You can
install dvd+rw-tools with following commands. Also note that this package
works under *BSD, HP-UX, Solaris and other UNIX like operating systems.

Debian installation:
# apt-get install 'dvd+rw-tools'

Fedora Core Linux installation:
# yum install 'dvd+rw-tools'

RedHat Enterprise Linux installation:
# up2date 'dvd+rw-tools'

In order to write DVD you need to install cdrecord tools.
How do I write DVD?

You need to use growisofs command, which combined mkisofs frontend/DVD
recording program. From growisofs man page, "growisofs was originally designed
as a frontend to mkisofs to facilitate appending of data to ISO9660 volumes
residing on random-access media such as DVD+RW, DVD-RAM, plain files, hard
disk partitions. In the course of development general purpose DVD recording
support was implemented, and as of now growisofs supports not only
random-access media, but even mastering of multiession DVD media such as DVD+R
and DVD-R/-RW. In addition growisofs supports first-/single-session recording
of arbitrary pre-mastered image (formatted as UDF, ISO9660 or any other file
system, if formatted at all) to all supported DVD media types."

First create the ISO image
# mkisofs -r -o /tmp/var-www-disk1.iso /var/www

Now use the growisofs command to write the ISO onto the DVD:
# growisofs -Z /dev/dvd=/tmp/var-www-disk1.iso

To append more data for same DVD:
# growisofs -M /dev/dvd /tmp/file.1

To format (erase) a DVD:
# dvd+rw-format -force /dev/dvd
OR
# dvd+rw-format -force=full /dev/dvd

The dvd+rw-format command formats dvd disk in the specified dvd drive.

To display information about dvd drive and disk using dvd+rw-mediainfo
command:
# dvd+rw-mediainfo /dev/dvd

    Since growisofs has an inbuilt functionality that allows to directly pipe
mkisofs’s output, it is probably more common that you call it without making
an ISO beforehand. Note also that it’s absolutely not needed to format a
DVD+RW more than once. You can just write again with the -Z option in later
runs. Yes, this is different from CD-RWs.

    man growisofs is a much better manual to using growisofs

    Since having growisofs make the iso as it burns has already been mentioned
here is another tip…

    Before you start burning use par2create from par2cmdline
(http://parchive.sourceforge.net/) to generate enough par2 recovery blocks to
fill any space that is left on the disc. That way if the disc gets damaged
later you may be able to recover the lost data.

    I have written a perl script to calculate out the correct number of par2
blocks to generate and to do it (it also makes a .md5 file). I have published
the script here: http://www.sanitarium.net/unix_stuff/par2calc.txt

    if the DVD gets damaged, how can you recover the file? Even it’s not only
that the file is corrupted. It’s also that you can’t actually read the dvd.
The dvd reader woudl go crazy and you wouldn’t be able to copy the damaged
file to disk, afaik?

    Heh
    perhaps what op or his script suggesting that you can recover particular
block provided that DVD can be read by DVD drive.

    But in most case DVD reader refuses to read corrupted DVD. I have used
Sony, HP, Samsung DVD/RW etc none of they were able to read corrupted DVD.

    Thanks for the howto, I don’t think I would have figured out which tool to
use otherwise.

    True, the man page for growisofs has more complete info, but I would have
never know to look for growisofs without the page. I would not have felt
confident in using mkisofs and growisofs together without this example. So I’d
like to thank the author for his redundancy. This explanation works for the
way I think.

    Using PAR2 on removable media is not as daft as some of you think.

    I’ve read from a CD in the past where an edge… erm, chord, containing data
had actually broken off!

    Just use dd it to a disk image (possibly adding options
conv=noerror,sync).

    It’ll probably make loads of strange noises and take ages, but you should
be able to do it depending on where the damage is… unles your disk blows up in
the process of course!

    Nice.

    How about DVD-RW packet-writing and UDF filesystem.

    Will these steps work on RHEL4/RHEL5?

    Will we need to mount the DVD drive before burning?

    Yes it should work on RHEL 4 / 5. No need to mount dvd.

    I had a broken(?) DVD RW disc, that NeroLinux isn’t wrote. I run
“dvd+rw-format -force=full /dev/dvd ” command on my Gentoo, later I wrote that
DVD without any problem! Thaks a lot! :-)

    Now use the growisofs command to write the ISO onto the DVD:
    # growisofs -Z /dev/dvd=/tmp/var-www-disk1.iso

    This will literally write an iso image into a directory on the DVD, which
is probably not what most people want. I used this command:
    growisofs -Z /dev/sr0=movie.iso
    and now have a disc with an ISO image, and not an ISO image that was
copied litereally on the DVD. Not a lot of use for my DVD player, and the
waste of a DVD-R disc. Opps.
    Oh well.

    Update:
    This is the command as specified in the man page, # man growisofs :-
    To use growisofs to write a pre-mastered ISO-image to a DVD:

    growisofs -dvd-compat -Z /dev/dvd=image.iso

    Do not use the example above, which is
    # growisofs -Z /dev/dvd=/tmp/var-www-disk1.iso

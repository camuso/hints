It's possible that your current login username is NOT the same as your Red Hat ID (email address without "@redhat.com"), or you may be logged on as root, so you may need to run the command as below (replace "hzhao" with your own Red Hat ID):

[root@hzhao ~]# kinit hzhao@REDHAT.COM
Password for hzhao@REDHAT.COM:

Attention: Please use capital REDHAT.COM

[root@hzhao ~]# klist 
Ticket cache: FILE:/tmp/krb5cc_0
Default principal: hzhao@REDHAT.COM

Valid starting     Expires            Service principal
01/13/11 15:54:36  01/14/11 01:54:30  krbtgt/REDHAT.COM@REDHAT.COM

 

You can destroy the Kerberos ticket and stop Kerberos authentication any time by running:

[hzhao@hzhao ~]$ kdestroy

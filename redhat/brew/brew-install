New method
---------

Install koji

For RHEL6, go to http://download.devel.redhat.com/rel-eng/brew/rhel/6Workstation/

yum install http://download.devel.redhat.com/rel-eng/brew/rhel/6Workstation/koji-1.8.0-7.el6.noarch.rpm

 To configure Koji to talk to Brew, add the following section to your ~/.koji/config:

[brew]
server = http://brewhub.devel.redhat.com/brewhub
authtype = kerberos
topdir = /mnt/redhat/brewroot
weburl = http://brewweb.devel.redhat.com/brew
topurl = http://download.devel.redhat.com/brewroot
#topurl = http://download.lab.bos.redhat.com/brewroot
#
#(If you are local to BOS, you should use the alternate topurl)
#
#Then add the symlink:
#
## ln -s /usr/bin/koji ~/bin/brew
#

A tip related to the VI editor

Often when we receive files by e-mail, we find an unwanted character "^M"
(CTRL-M) at several places. This is the control character roughly equivalent
of a carriage return. If you use vi, like I do, a natural thing is to try
and get rid of this using "global substitution", which is done using:

:g/A/s//B/g

The above command replaces string "A" by the string "B". So we can use "^M"
for "A" and " " (empty space) for "B". But then as soon as we try to type
"^M" in place of "A", it is treated as carriage return, and we are back in
the file. A way to avoid this is to type "^V" (CTRL-V) before "^M".

Thus, to simply remove all the occurances of "^M", use:

:g/^V^M/s// /g

Sometimes, this "^M" appears inadvertantly and makes the entire file as a
single line. A solution to that is to replace "^M" by itself! Thus you
use:

:g/^V^M/s//^V^M/g

By the way, all the "V" and "M" when keyed with "CTRL" are actually in
lowercase and one doesn't have to use the "SHIFT" or "CAPS LOCK" keys
while entering them.

To open a file with split windows

vim -o file1 file2	# split horizontally
vim -O file1 file2	# split vertically

vim -y			# "easy" mode

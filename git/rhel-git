I'm not, usually this kind of stuff goes through eng-ops@redhat.com but
in this case you don't need anybody to help you:

	1) log in a machine with your NFS home mounted like
	   shell.devel.redhat.com
	2) create a directory "public_git" inside your home if it's not
	   already created
	3) create a directory with a "bare" repository:
	3.1) empty repository:
		$ mkdir myproject.git
		$ cd myproject.git/
		$ git init --bare
	3.2) clone existing
		$ git clone --bare git://git.app.eng.bos.redhat.com/rhel6.git myrhel6.git
		$ cd myrhel6.git/
	4) edit "description" and "config" as you wish
	5) git update-server-info


For pushing, the url should be:
	tcamuso@git.engineering.redhat.com:/srv/git/users/tcamuso/<repo-name>
For pulling:
	git://git.engineering.redhat.com/users/tcamuso/<repo-name>

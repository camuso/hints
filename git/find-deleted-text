It's important to understand how git log walks the history if you
specify the path. See all the explanation about "TREESAME" in the man.

In your case, when run on upstream, the path with the hci_cleanup_dev
change gets pruned. If you try:

git log --full-history -S"hci_cleanup_dev" include/net/bluetooth/hci_core.h

you will get e04480920d1ee as you expect.

Now, why you don't see anything that removes the line? It's because
there's no such removal(!). In general, when something weird like what
you're seeing happens, in 99% cases the culprit is a merge commit.

This will help to see what was going on:

git log --full-history --simplify-merges --graph v5.15 -- include/net/bluetooth/hci_core.h

Search for e04480920d1ee and follow the graph up. The suspected merge
is e61fbee7be4b9. Indeed, if you look at the two commits that it
merged, 815cc21d8d2e and 61969ef867d4[*], the merge took the right side
and dropped the left side.

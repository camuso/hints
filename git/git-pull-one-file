    you can use git archive (see Jared Forsyth's answer and Robert Knight's answer), since git1.7.9.5 (March 2012):

    git archive --remote=git://git.foo.com/project.git HEAD:path/to/directory filename | tar -x

    That will save a copy of 'filename' from the HEAD of the remote
    repository in the current directory.

    The :path/to/directory part is optional. If excluded, the fetched
    file will be saved to <current working
    dir>/path/to/directory/filename.

Fizer Khan mentions below specifying the tar format explicitly:

git archive --format=tar --remote=origin HEAD -- <file> | tar xf -

It is similar to Paul Brannan's answer:

git archive --format=tar --remote=origin HEAD:path/to/directory -- filename | tar -O -xf -

As commented by Doron Gold, for git archive --remote=xxx to work, you
MUST first run this inside the directory of your repository on your git
server (where git daemon runs):

git config daemon.uploadarch true

See patthoyts' comment of 2009 Jakub Narębski's answer on "git: Retrieve
a single file from a repository".

    or you must clone first the repo, meaning you get the full history:
        in the .git repo
        in the working tree.

    But then you can do a sparse checkout (if you are using Git1.7+),:
        enable the sparse checkout option (git config core.sparsecheckout true)
        adding what you want to see in the .git/info/sparse-checkout file
        re-reading the working tree to only display what you need

To re-read the working tree:

$ git read-tree -m -u HEAD

That way, you end up with a working tree including precisely what you
want (even if it is only one file) shareedit

can you commit the changes in the sparse checkout? – Tilo Jan 11 '12 at

@Tilo: not sure, but it should be possible, considering the clone has
been a full one. – VonC Jan 11 '12 at 7:02 1 	 
	
How's this better than "git checkout HASH path-to-file" as noted in
other answers? was that just not available at the time? – thatjuan Aug

@juand the idea was to not have to load the all working tree before
doing git checkout. – VonC Aug 30 '12 at 18:04 1 	 
	
btw we can use git archive now. – Jared Forsyth Sep 10 '13 at 7:14

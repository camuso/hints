git lock after git crash
------------------------
http://www.smooka.com/blog/2010/12/09/fix-git-lock-after-git-crash/

If you ever see the following message when trying to commit your code to a GIT repository.

    If no other git process is currently running, this probably means a
    git process crashed in this repository earlier. Make sure no other git
    process is running and remove the file manually to continue.


The solution is very easy, just delete the .git/index.lock file
~ rm /yourhomedir/.git/index.lock

Then you need to do a git reset
~ git reset

That should do the trick. Let me know if this worked for you.

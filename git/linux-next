just a quick tip, i think it's often useful to pull in
linux-next git trees:

$ git remote add next \
   git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git

$ git remote update

then you could:

$ git tag --contains 5865fc1b6a99bc7dcf245770c2735577b8596b6e
next-20130625
next-20130626
next-20130628

which means it's probably coming in from net-next.git

I also believe, if later you realize there was another branch you wanted
in addition to linux-next, you can just re-run the 'git remote add -t ..'
command to append new branches.  Though I haven't tried that in awhile.

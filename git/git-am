First, extract the patches from your email using mutt.
See ~/hints/mutt/folders.txt

git am /home/tcamuso/Maildir/{subfolder}/cur/*.patch

If anything goes wrong ...

git am --abort

... is your freind.

Do not try to apply empty patches, like patch 00 of {n}.
Patch 00 typically has only commentary.

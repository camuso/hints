kill -STOP 1721
	Stops (suspends) process 1721 by sending the STOP signal
	to the process. This process will still be on the task list.
	The process can't catch or ignore the STOP signal.

kill -CONT 1721
	Continue process 1721 causing it to resume. The CONT signal
	is sent to the process.

kill -TERM 1721
	Terminates process 1721 by sending the TERM signal to the
	process. This process will no longer show up on the task
	list if it is actually terminated. Process terminated cannot
	be continued. The TERM signal can be caught so TERM is not
	guaranteed to kill the process.

kill -HUP 1721
	Stops, then restarts process 1721. This is usually done when
	a process is not working properly or the configuration files
	for that process have been changed. This command sends the
	HUP signal to the process which means hangup. This signal
	can be caught by the process.

killall -HUP myprint
	Restarts any process with the name "myprint".

kill -TERM myprint
	Terminates any process with the name "myprint".

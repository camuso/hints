I followed the directions in:

http://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/17/html/Security_Guide/Security_Guide-Encryption-Data_in_Motion.html#sect-Security_Guide-Virtual_Private_Networks_VPNs

I have openswan installed: openswan-2.6.37-3.fc17.x86_64. The docs say
to also install ipsec-tools. The IPSEC wizard is a tab in
system-config-network.

I checked the F18 docs. Same as F17.

So I think I am running the prefered infrastructure. Or is there some
other guide I'm missing?

In any event, has anybody using any vpn package been able to set it up
for a roaming client?

-----------------------------------------

And since Openswan has been forked into Libreswan you may want to look
into that. The Libreswan team has just released a new version with lots
of fixes and enhancements.

See http://libreswan.org

I use ssh tunnels to forward Android imap (port 143), smtp (port 25), and
http proxying (port 3128) to my Fedora server, using this app:

http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.ayal.SPT

The main gotcha is that each tablet needs its own dedicated ssh port, so
that the office NAT/firewall/router can keep track of ssh sessions
correctly. But that is easy to implement, for a handful of devices.

It works quite well for my needs.

Interesting. This look like a very "light weight" solution.

What do you use as a proxy on the Fedora server? glype? squid?

On the android you configure a proxy for each browser? Or does SPT
just send all port 80 requests to the server?

Any details on the config would be very helpful.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Install the SPT app & forward local ports 1043, 1125, and 3128 to remote
143 (imap), 25 (smtp), 3128 (squid proxy).

In my case, SPT Forwards = "L1043=192.168.0.2:143,L1125=192.168.0.2:25,L3128=192.168.0.2:3128"

Here, 192.168.0.2 is the internal address of my server (not its external IP).

The forwarded local ports need to be > 1024, IIRC.

You point the email client at localhost for the SMTP/IMAP, using the special
local forwarding ports 1043 and 1125.

For web use, I use Firefox, and in about:config set:

network.proxy.type = 2
network.proxy.autoconfig_url = http://www.avtechpulse.com/proxy/avtech.pac

That *.pac file says:

function FindProxyForURL(url, host) {
    if (shExpMatch(host, "*.domain.avtechpulse.com"))
        {
        return "PROXY 127.0.0.1:3128";
        }

     return "DIRECT";
}

That means squid serves the private intranet pages from the private squid
server, and firefox accesses all other pages in the normal manner (not
through squid).

Firefox is the only browser that handles this proxy trickery well.

Sounds complicated, but works like a charm.

----------------------------------

We use a Cisco VPN, so I just use my 'Droid as a mobile hotspot (or a
tethered modem), then use vpnc to open a VPN off our VPN gateway and it
works fine. I prefer the tethered mechanism for security reasons.

Note that it also works using my Verizon 4G hotspot doo-dad in wifi
mode. I haven't tried it in bluetooth or tethered mode yet because
every time I dig it out, it's because others in my group need access
as well so I have to share--usually preceeded with my grumbling.

Here's my expurgated /etc/vpnc/default.conf file:

    # VPN Setup...
    # Don't timeout...keep going
    DPD idle timeout (our side) 0
    # Force Cisco UDP NAT mode (for idiot routers that use MTUs
    # <1500 bytes...may not be necessary at all times)...
    #NAT Traversal Mode cisco-udp
    IPSec gateway <MY-VPN-GATEWAY>
    IPSec ID <MY-GROUP-ID-ON-VPN-GATEWAY>
    IPSec secret <GROUP-PASSWORD-ON-VPN-GATEWAY>
    Xauth username <MY-USERNAME-ON-VPN-GATEWAY>
    Xauth password <MY-PASSWORD-ON-VPN-GATEWAY>

I normally connect to the wifi hotspot off the 'Droid or 4G access
point, then run "vpnc" and off we go.

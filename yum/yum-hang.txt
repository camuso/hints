I was having this exact issue recently. Or at least, Yum was hanging at 
the same stage as what you describe.

It was recommended to me on this list to do the following:

cd /var/lib/rpm
rm __db.00*
rpm --rebuilddb


This seems to have cleared up the problem for me. It might work for you.

I'm a newbie though, so maybe I'm missing the mark on what your problem 
is. I hope it helps, though.

This has proven useful to me when attempting to update ProLiant BIOS in
the following circumstances.

* There is no Linux shell script available for your distribution and you
  ust use the DOS-based ROMPAQ

* You, or the customer you are trying to help, cannot be on-site to connect
  a USB thumb drive with the ROMPAQ update on it.

The method is somewhat obvious, but here it is, just in case it could save
anybody pain or time.

* Download the ROMPAQ from the HP Drivers & Support web page for your
  specific ProLiant.

* Follow the instructions on the web page to create the ROMPAQ bootable
  USB on a windows machine, using the HPQUSB.exe utility and the lowest
  capacity USB key available to you.

* Connect the USB drive to a Linux host, but do not mount. If it
  automatically mounts, dismount it.

* Use parted, or gparted if you prefer gui, to resize the USB partition
  containing the ROMPAQ to about 10% more than the smallest size. You
  should be able to get it down to 64 MB, anyway. The reason for this is
  to make uploading faster.

* Use dd to create the bootable USB image file. The following example
  command will create a 66MB bootable USB image file, where "/dev/sdc"
  is the USB drive and "SP53709.fls" is the name of the output file

	# dd if=/dev/sdc of=SP53709.fls bs=1M count=66

* Upload the bootable USB image file to a system local to the target
  system, which is also running the iLO interface to the target system.

* From the iLO's Virtual Media interface, load the USB image file as a
  USB key and boot.

* ROM update should occur automatically, or you could type "ROMPAQ" at
  the DOS prompt.

Use runlevel to determine if X is running.

runlevel

yum install nmap
yum grouplist | grep X
yum grouplist | grep -i desk

yum groupinstall "X Window System"
yum groupinstall Desktop

# The following is not necessary if Desktop has been installed.
# It's included here for reference purposes.

yum groupinstall "Destop Platform"

look in /var/log/Xorg.0.log for errors

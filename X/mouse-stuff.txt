r/bin/xinput'

for F in `$X list|grep Logitech|cut -d = -f 2|cut -c1-3` ; do
  $X set-prop $F "Evdev Middle Button Emulation"
done

Since F-14 I have had to fix this problem after new installs and occasionally
after updates by editing /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-evdev.conf by adding
following at the end the:

Section "InputClass"
     Identifier		"whatever"
     MatchIsPointer	"on"
     Option		"Emulate3Buttons" "on"
EndSection

Section "InputClass"
     Identifier		"system-setup-keyboard"
     MatchIsKeyboard	"on"
     Option		"XkbOptions" "terminate:ctrl_alt_bksp"
EndSection

The second section is to make Control+Alternate+Backspace work again which you
may not care about. I think this requires a reboot?

I was given the following suggestion which has worked for other but not for 
me. Does this give anyone any ideas what I can try next?

I had the same issue with a Dell when I upgraded to Fedora 18, so I
added 'i8042.reset i8042.nomux=1' (without quotes) at the end of the
kernel boot options in Grub:

[root@portdav2 ~]# cat /etc/default/grub
GRUB_TIMEOUT=5
GRUB_DISTRIBUTOR="Fedora"
GRUB_DEFAULT=saved
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="rd.md=0 rd.lvm=0 rd.dm=0 SYSFONT=True rd.luks=0
LANG=es_ES.UTF-8 KEYTABLE=es i8042.reset i8042.nomux=1"
[root@portdav2 ~]#
